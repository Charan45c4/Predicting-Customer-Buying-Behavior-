# Predicting-Customer-Buying-Behavior-

Project Overview: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior Using Random Forest

Objective: The objective of this project is to predict customer buying behavior based on various factors such as demographic information, purchasing history, and other customer characteristics. The goal is to build a model that accurately classifies customers into groups based on their likelihood of making a purchase, using the Random Forest algorithm.

Steps Involved:

Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, duplicates, and outliers to ensure clean input for the model.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones, such as creating a binary target variable representing whether a customer made a purchase or not.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding to handle categorical data (e.g., gender, region).

Feature Scaling: Standardizing or normalizing numerical features if needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data Visualization: Plotting distributions of different features, visualizing correlations, and identifying trends that might influence buying behavior.

Feature Importance Analysis: Using techniques like correlation matrices or tree-based methods to identify the most significant features influencing customer behavior.

Modeling:

Random Forest Algorithm: Implementing the Random Forest classifier, which is an ensemble learning method. It constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (for classification problems) of the individual trees.

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize parameters like the number of trees, maximum depth, etc.

Using cross-validation to prevent overfitting and to assess the modelâ€™s performance across different subsets of the data.

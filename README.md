# Predicting-Customer-Buying-Behavior-

Project Overview: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior Using Random Forest

Objective: The objective of this project is to predict customer buying behavior based on various factors such as demographic information, purchasing history, and other customer characteristics. The goal is to build a model that accurately classifies customers into groups based on their likelihood of making a purchase, using the Random Forest algorithm.

Steps Involved:

Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, duplicates, and outliers to ensure clean input for the model.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones, such as creating a binary target variable representing whether a customer made a purchase or not.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding to handle categorical data (e.g., gender, region).

Feature Scaling: Standardizing or normalizing numerical features if needed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data Visualization: Plotting distributions of different features, visualizing correlations, and identifying trends that might influence buying behavior.

Feature Importance Analysis: Using techniques like correlation matrices or tree-based methods to identify the most significant features influencing customer behavior.
